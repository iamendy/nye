## ‚ú® Description

Ny√© creates a secure and transparent ecosystem for donors and NGOs. Users can donate on Toronet, and Ny√© ensures it reaches the beneficiary wallet!

[Ny√©](https://nye-toro.vercel.app) combines the speed, scalability and affordability of Toronet to allow users to donate to any cause using toro tokens.

When users donate, they earn Ny√© tokens that allow them to participate in the dApp's future and community.
