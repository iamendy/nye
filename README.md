## ‚ú® Description

Ny√© creates a secure and transparent ecosystem for donors and NGOs. Users can donate on Toronet, and Ny√© ensures it reaches the beneficiary wallet!

[Ny√© Smart contract](https://nye-toro.vercel.app) combines the speed, scalability and affordability of Toronet to allow users to donate to any cause using toro tokens.

## üíª How we built Ny√©

We created and deployed Ny√© smart contract on Toronet

1. Nye - [view on Toroscan](https://testnet.toronet.org/address.html?address=0x85f88714a9Bd14B6Da0c2a96a9D867Fb9c822FB3)

Here are some of the recent transactions on Ny√©:

This is an original work by our team. We built our solution using: **`NextJs/Typescript`**, **`Wagmi`**, **`Rainbowkit`**, **`Prisma`**, **`TailwindCSS`**, **`Remix`**, and **`PostgresSQL`**.

## üíª What next?

We are excited to have participated in the hackathon and commited to building further. Beyond our MVP for the hackathon,we also plan on:

1. Add support for ToroUSD, ToroEUR,and toroNGN to allow users donate with any token of their choice!
2. Add a governance token as reward for donation. When users donate, they earn Ny√© tokens that allow them to participate in the dApp's future and community.
